        <p>I attend Stanford University, and currently plan on graduating with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.</p>

        <p>I worked at Google in the summer of 2019, and I was able to work on the Mountain View campus. Quite a bit different than working from home!</p>

        <p>These are my parents! They've always supported me in everything that I've tried, and are always encouraging me to learn and try new things.</p>

        <p>Speaking of trying new things, my mom and I flew out to a taping of The Price is Right, and actually got on the show!</p>
