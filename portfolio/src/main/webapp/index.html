      <p>I am a rising junior currently attending Stanford University. I am
          studying Computer Science as my major, while minoring in Mathematics. 
          This summer, I am working at Google while at home with my family in Memphis, 
          Tennessee. For fun, I enjoy playing tennis, playing video and board games with friends, 
          and going to the gym. I have always been a big fan of the Memphis Grizzlies, and follow the
          NBA pretty closely as well. As far as video games that I play frequently, I play 
          a lot of Overwatch, and recently started getting into SMITE.
